Sporing is a game developed in Unity. The music and audio were designed, created, and run through SuperCollider, an environment for audio synthesis and algorithmic composition. The connection between Unity and SuperCollider is established through the OSC protocol: Unity sends messages using the extOSC library to SuperCollider, which responds to those messages by generating audio or modifying its parameters in real-time.
